    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: April 2025</p>

    <section>
      <p>HabitTracker (“the App”), created by Halyna Mazur, respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the App collects, uses, and protects your information. By using HabitTracker, you agree to the terms described here.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>The App is designed to operate entirely on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Habits and progress history:</strong> Saved locally on your device using Apple’s UserDefaults system.</li>
        <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Stored locally to maintain your preferences.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>No account registration is required, and no personally identifiable information is collected.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
      <p>All data is stored locally on your device. If you delete the App, your data is permanently removed unless you restore it from an iCloud or device backup.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to any third parties. Your habit data never leaves your device.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>The App does not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Security</h2>
      <p>Since data is stored locally on your device, its security depends on your device’s built-in protections, such as iOS security and backup settings. We recommend enabling device passcodes and iCloud backups if you want to protect or restore your data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>HabitTracker does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. As the app stores no external data, children’s usage is fully local to their device.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with the updated effective date. We encourage you to review it periodically.</p>
    </section>
